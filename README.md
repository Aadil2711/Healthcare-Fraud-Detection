# Healthcare Fraud Detection
This healthcare fraud detection project aims to detect fraudulent activities in healthcare insurance claims using machine learning techniques.
The project will analyze historical healthcare insurance data to identify patterns and anomalies that are indicative of fraud. 
By applying classification algorithms and anomaly detection methods, the project seeks to build a model that can accurately flag potentially fraudulent claims. 
The ultimate goal is to help healthcare providers and insurers identify and prevent fraud, ultimately reducing costs and improving the efficiency of healthcare systems.
